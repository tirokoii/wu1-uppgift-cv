            <p>Dear Mr Zavala,</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am reaching out to you about the position of AI consultor that I found on helpus.com.</p>
            <p>I am very interested in this position and I would appreciate it if you considered my application for this position.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In my previous experience, I have built and programmed AI robots with human consciousness.</p>
            <p>I also have experience in managing a company when I was CEO of Clovis Bray for around 200 years and for the last 2000 years I have been in the position of AI god</p>
            <p>Which shows that I have the capability for this position.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have a strong sense of responsibility when it comes to my job, I always prioritize my work in every situation</p>
            <p>Solving problems and coming up with clever solutions is one of my strongest properties.</p>
            <p>I have always loved the challenging part of solving problems for others. Whenever someone needs a helping hand I feel that it is my duty to give it to them.</p>
            <p>I believe that my strong sense of responsibility and problem solving skills will be a great asset to your Vanguard.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With my previous experiences in programming and science I can construct AI to aid with organising files in the database and aid with building ships that run on less fuel.</p>
            <p>My connection to the database makes it possible for me to strengthen the Last City's forces both internal and external. My only weakness is that I can not be moved around where there is no computer.</p>
            <p>Because my main consciousness is located on Europa and I'm capable of rebooting and copying my mind there is a low probability that my data will be destroyed.</p>
            <p>Internal attacks from vex will not be any problem either considering my protection system is extremely complex.</p>
            <p>I believe my future as an AI consultant is my best future.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I appreciate you taking the time to read and review this letter and hope to hear from you regarding the next steps in the hiring process.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Clovis Bray I</p>
